Experiments
###########

This example contains the IPython Notebook ``final.ipynb``, which has the code
for the experiments and plots for the thesis for which ``speechmatching`` was
originally written. The Notebook may be not well organized and does not contain
very clear notes and descriptions.

Setup
*****

After setting up the ``speechmatching`` package and the ``acoustic`` binary,
install the dependencies from ``requirements.txt`` and run::

    jupyter notebook

after which the ``final.ipynb`` file can be opened, and experimented with.
